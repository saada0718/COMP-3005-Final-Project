Install Instructions:

    -> NOTE: If you are having issues with some of these steps please refer to the submission video as it will have a visual demonstration
       of these steps.

    1. Make sure you have node js installed
        -> This depends on the operating system; thus, I cannot provide instructions for all platforms. (Please refer to the internet)

    2. Open up a terminal window and go to the COMP-3005-Final-Project-main/final_proj directory and type in 'npm install'

    3. Open PostgresSQL and create a database with the following information:

        -> host: 'localhost'
        -> user: 'postgres'
        -> port: '5432'
        -> password: 'postgres'
        -> database: 'postgres'

    4. Once the database is setup, copy lines 1 - 180 (inclusive) from SQL and run them in pgadmin4
        -> This is because, the application does not create the tables, admins, trainers, rooms, or equipment.
           This must be done manually via pgadmin.

Launch Instructions:

    1. Open up a terminal window and go to the COMP-3005-Final-Project-main/final_proj directory and type in node server.js
